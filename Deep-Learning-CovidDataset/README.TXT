Deep learning models applied in this project are: DNN, LSTM, and Simple RNN on covid dataset.The description of files are as below:
CM1 includes application of the models.
CM2 includes critical code blocks and loss-accuracy plots with various combination of optimizers-alpha values.
CM3 includes performance parameters of models.
